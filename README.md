# Circulli Bellum 

<!-- simply ![footage](readme_content/cb.gif) does not work -->

**Circulli Bellum** is my clone of the game **"ROUNDS"**, but *somewhat* from scratch. The game uses [Box2D](https://github.com/erincatto/box2d) for physics and Vulkan for graphics (via [Lum-al](https://github.com/platonvin/lum-al))

Everything is drawn as a basic shape to use power of SDF's for "software" antalisaing (like MSAA but better)
 
To enhance viusals, there is bloom effect, separate shadow pass, and some simple chromatic aberration.

Itâ€™s not super optimized on the GPU-side (for that, check out my other project [Lum](https://github.com/platonvin/lum) ), but still runs pretty well
